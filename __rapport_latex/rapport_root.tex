\section{Introduction}

The ever-expanding volume of scientific literature presents a significant
challenge for researchers seeking to understand the trajectory of their field.
While traditional review articles provide invaluable summaries, computational
methods using text embeddings have emerged as a powerful tool for conducting
large-scale, data-driven analyses of entire research corpora. This approach has
been successfully used to map broad thematic trends by representing each
scientific article as a single vector in a high-dimensional "meaning space"
\autocite{Odden2024Using}.

However, analyzing articles as monolithic units has a key limitation: it
conflates the distinct functions of their constituent parts. An
article is not a single block of text, but a structured argument composed of an
\emph{Introduction}, \emph{Methods}, \emph{Results}, and \emph{Discussion}.
Reducing an entire article to a single data point risks obscuring these
distinct components, losing valuable information about a field's theoretical
foundations or the evolution of its research methods. A section-level analysis,
therefore, promises a more nuanced and powerful understanding of how a discipline
develops.

This report details a project that develops and evaluates a complete workflow for
such a section-level analysis, using a corpus of 1222 articles from the
\emph{Physical Review Physics Education Research} (PRPER) journal. Our primary
contributions are threefold. First, we develop and compare a suite of models for
classifying article sections by their section type. We demonstrate that while a
Large Language Model (LLM) using an external API achieves the highest accuracy
($\sim$90\%), our novel, projection-based MLP classifier provides a highly
competitive and computationally efficient local alternative ($\sim$80\%),
significantly outperforming a standard fine-tuned SciBERT model ($\sim$77\%).
Second, using these classifications, we introduce an iterative LLM-based method
to automatically discover and track the prevalence of specific theoretical
frameworks and research methods. Finally, we developed a use of projection-based
visualizations as a tool for exploring the semantic space of academic theories.

The report is structured as follows. We begin by preparing the data and
performing an initial exploration of the section embedding space. We then present
our detailed comparative analysis of the different section-type classifiers. The
report then demonstrates the utility of these classifications in two applications:
the fine-grained trend analysis using an iterative LLM and the exploratory
analysis using vector projections, before concluding with the implications of
this work.

\section{Conclusion}

This report set out to address a key limitation in the computational analysis of scientific literature: the loss of nuance when treating entire articles as single data points. We developed and evaluated a complete workflow for performing a fine-grained, section-level analysis of the PRPER corpus, demonstrating the feasibility and value of this approach.

Our initial exploration confirmed that while a section-level approach is necessary, it is also challenging, as the thematic signal of an article often dominates the more subtle rhetorical signal of its sections. To overcome this, we compared several supervised classification models. We found that a Large Language Model using an external API achieved the highest accuracy at $\sim$90\%, while a novel, projection-based MLP classifier offered a strong and computationally efficient local alternative ($\sim$80\%), outperforming a fine-tuned SciBERT model ($\sim$77\%).

Using the most accurate classifications, we pioneered a novel, iterative LLM-based method capable of discovering and categorizing specific theoretical frameworks and research methods directly from the text. This technique successfully mapped the conceptual evolution of the PRPER journal over two decades, showcasing its potential as a powerful tool for automated, data-driven literature reviews.

This work is not without limitations. The classification task is complicated by the inherent ambiguity of section boundaries, and the iterative analysis method requires significant computational resources and human-in-the-loop validation. Future work should focus on applying this workflow to other research corpora and refining the iterative classifier with more powerful models to better distinguish between the "use" and "discussion" of a concept. Further investigation into the semantic axes discovered through projection-based analysis could also yield more rigorous tools for interpreting the conceptual landscape of a scientific field.
